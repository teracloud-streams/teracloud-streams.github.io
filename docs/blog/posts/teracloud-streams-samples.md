# Teracloud Streams Samples

If you'd like to explore ready-to-run examples of Streams applications, we have published a set of samples in our [Teracloud Streams GitHub Organization](https://github.com/teracloud-streams).  The [samples repository](https://github.com/teracloud-streams/samples) contains a collection of Streams applications complete with code and supporting artifacts required to build and run each sample. 

The collection includes a set of **Examples-for-Beginners** showcasing key capabilities of the Streams programming model, updated and modernized for Teracloud Streams 7.x. This set of samples has been a popular way to learn about Streams applications and to understand how specific constructs can be applied in new applications.  

The samples are excellent resources to reference, but they are also useful to practice building and running applications. To build and run the applications, you will need a Teracloud Streams development environment. If you don't have one, you can set up one for free using [these instructions](https://teracloud-streams.github.io/gettingstarted/basics/#set-up-a-development-environment).

Additional samples beyond Examples-for-beginners are being added, so stay tuned for upcoming blog posts to feature those and other material in our GitHub organization.

If you ever have any questions, comments or suggestions for the Teracloud Streams team, feel free to [contact us](https://streams.teracloud.com/contact).
